# Hinglish Translation Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Hinglish Translation model, which translates English text into Hinglish (a blend of Hindi and English). Hinglish is often used in multilingual and multicultural communities, making it a valuable tool for communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use this Hinglish Translation model, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- The `transformers` library: You can install it using `pip install transformers`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/SIDDU-9494/hinglish.git
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
## Running the Model
To translate English text into Hinglish using this model, you can use the provided script translate.py. Here's how to use it:
python translate.py --input "Your English text here"
The translated text will be displayed in the terminal.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use the model:
python translate.py --input "Today's weather forecast predicts heavy rainfall in the evening, so it's advisable to carry an umbrella when you go out."
This will produce a Hinglish translation of the input text.

### Performance Evaluation

## Metrics
Performance metrics such as translation accuracy and fluency are important for evaluating the quality of the Hinglish translations generated by this model. We use BLEU score and Fluency Score for evaluation.

If you wish to evaluate the model's performance on a custom dataset, you can use the evaluate.py script:
python evaluate.py --input input_data.txt --ground-truth ground_truth_data.txt
